# Autonomous E.R Patient Bed

This project focuses on developing an autonomous patient bed system designed to navigate through hospital corridors and efficiently transport patients between departments. The project integrates pathfinding algorithms like A* and Dijkstra to determine the most efficient routes within a hospital layout.

## Project Overview

The autonomous E.R patient bed aims to address the challenges faced in hospital logistics, such as staff shortages and emergency room congestion, by enabling patient beds to autonomously transport patients to their designated locations within the hospital.

## Features
- **Pathfinding Algorithms:** Utilizes A* and Dijkstra algorithms to determine optimal routes.
- **Autonomous Navigation:** The bed can navigate hospital corridors and elevators, minimizing human intervention.

## Documentation

Detailed documentation about the project can be found in the [docs/](docs/) directory:
- **Autonomous E.R Patient Bed.pdf:** Contains the project report and detailed explanation of the system.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of a hospital map and the path generated by the A* algorithm:
